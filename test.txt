Test: LedyardBridgeSim
Usage: ./bridge num_cars
	- creates random number of cars (threads) with random directions and speeds
	- printing states will show where these different threads are so I will show 	  different cases with these random tests
	- MAX_CARS is hardcoded and for these tests I use 3 as max cars on bridge	

test cases:  num_cars = 2,3,5,10,100

(1) ./bridge 2 - output:
car 1 waiting in direction TO_NORWICH
car 1 on bridge TO_NORWICH
Bridge State: 1 cars on bridge TO_NORWICH
0 cars waiting to go to TO_NORWICH
0 cars waiting to go to TO_HANOVER
car 0 waiting in direction TO_NORWICH
car 0 on bridge TO_NORWICH
Bridge State: 2 cars on bridge TO_NORWICH
0 cars waiting to go to TO_NORWICH
0 cars waiting to go to TO_HANOVER
car 1 went TO_NORWICH
car 0 went TO_NORWICH
2 cars have exited successfully.

This test shows liveness -  if a car gets on the bridge, it will eventually cross and get off. Both cars do that here. 
This test shows efficiency - if there are fewer than MAX_CARS on the bridge and a car is waiting to go in the same direction then that car will get on the bridge too; example, car 0 waits and immediately gets on the bridge.

(2) ./bridge 3 - output:
car 0 waiting in direction TO_HANOVER
car 0 on bridge TO_HANOVER
Bridge State: 1 cars on bridge TO_HANOVER
0 cars waiting to go to TO_HANOVER
0 cars waiting to go to TO_NORWICH
car 1 waiting in direction TO_NORWICH
car 2 waiting in direction TO_NORWICH
car 0 went TO_HANOVER
car 2 on bridge TO_NORWICH
Bridge State: 2 cars on bridge TO_NORWICH
0 cars waiting to go to TO_NORWICH
0 cars waiting to go to TO_HANOVER
car 1 on bridge TO_NORWICH
Bridge State: 2 cars on bridge TO_NORWICH
0 cars waiting to go to TO_NORWICH
0 cars waiting to go to TO_HANOVER
car 1 went TO_NORWICH
car 2 went TO_NORWICH
3 cars have exited successfully.

This test shows safety - car 0 wants to go to Hanover and cars 1 and 2 want to go to Norwich. Because car 0 arrives at the bridge first, traffic is going to Hanover. Cars 1 and 2 wait until car 0 “went TO_HANOVER” before getting on the bridge and thus avoiding collisions.
This test shows liveness - after car 0 leaves the bridge there are no cars on the bridge, so cars 1 and 2 get on. If there are no cars on the bridge, a car waiting will get on.

car 1 waiting in direction TO_HANOVER

Bridge State: 1 cars on bridge TO_NORWICH
0 cars waiting to go to TO_NORWICH
0 cars waiting to go to TO_HANOVER
car 2 went TO_NORWICH
5 cars have exited successfully.

This test shows safety - there cannot be more than MAX_CARS on the bridge at once in this case 3 is the max. car 1 is the first to get on the bridge to Hanover, then car 3, then car 4, leaving car 0 waiting in direction to Hanover. The state of car 4 on the bridge does not capture car 0 arriving yet but that’s ok. As we can see in this output car 0 does not get onto the bridge until car 3 leaves.

10 cars have exited successfully.

This test shows no direction is starved - instead of having my cars cross the bridge in two arbitrary clusters, I considered myself as a car waiting in line at the bridge and realizing that for example if I was 1 out of 10 cars randomly generated going to Hanover and I’m not the first car to get there in my code, I would have to wait much too long! So to ensure no direction is starved waiting for cars in the other direction during their morning commute, I set the quota for the bridge to be the same as the MAX_CARS that cross. In this case, 3. Once 3 cars have crossed the bridge, I shut off the gate for all cars in that direction. Which means some cars that had previously been on the bridge are still allowed to cross, but after the last one of them has crossed, I broadcast cvar in the opposite direction. So say I was that 1 car going to Hanover out of 9, instead of waiting for all 9 cars to cross first, my wait is cut down to 5 cars now. 
In the output above, we see cars 0, 3, and 2 are the first three cars to get on the bridge to Hanover. Car 2 gets off first and car 5 hops on, there remain 3 cars on the bridge to Hanover. Then car 0 exits and car 1 gets on the bridge. Finally when, car 3 exits, the bridge will allow traffic from the other direction. However, cars 5 and 1 remain on the bridge so we let them exit before we allow car 6 on bridge to Norwich. This repeats itself allowing less than 2*MAX_CARS to pass through in any given direction before switching directions. This traffic switch of course gets varied by the overflowed cars as seen in the example above.

(5) ./bridge 100 - output:

This test is really annoying to read, but I needed to use a large number to show my edge case. Below you can see that my code indicates that there is a collision, the direction of traffic does not match the direction of the car that just got on. There are two examples of this happening. I do not know how to solve this, unfortunately but it occurs very rarely and seems to be more of an issue with the placing of my print statement for finding collisions and my method of implementing starvation prevention by flipping a traffic signal, although I think it remains to be in the best place. The integrity (safety) of the bridge is still kept in tact and the bridge remains efficient and lively.
First, example shows 3 cars going to Hanover and then getting off, car 83 gets on the bridge to Norwich, and so does car 56, there also appears to be a mystery car that appears since it says there are 3 cars on the bridge to Norwich when I only counted 2 and when car 83 leaves, car 58 is also trying to go to Norwich and there indicates there is a collision. I suspect that when car 83 left, it flipped the traffic switch while car 58 was just getting on so that it signaled that it was not in the flow of traffic when it was really the last car allowed to cross in that direction.

The second case, seems to be the same kind of edge case when a thread is just getting on the bridge while the traffic switch is flipped. Notice it’s an error in the same place.
